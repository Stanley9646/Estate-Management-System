                     <h2>Meet Our Founder</h2>
                    <p>For years, Estate Management Systems (EMS) Founder Ashley Achieng had a successful career as a landscaping designer and contractor – she supervised million-dollar renovations and $100,000+ yearly estate maintenance accounts. She was also a licensed general building contractor with a roster of satisfied UHNW clients.

                        Through those connections, she eventually transitioned to estate management, which included five luxury properties from Los Angeles to London, with five full-time staff and over 80 subcontractors.
                        
                        
                        While serving as an estate manager for some of the wealthiest families in the world…
                        
                        Kelly was often given monumental requests with very few resources and was often overwhelmed with day-to-day demands.</p>

                    <h3>How Estate Management Systems Started</h3>
                    <p>Finally reaching a break point where note-taking and incomplete checklists weren’t serving her anymore, Ashley  realized that she needed a better way to track projects, capture principal requests, and communicate with her staff. It became clear to her that private service lacked management tools beyond an Excel spreadsheet and a Google calendar.

                        This experience compelled her to create her Estate Management Systems (EMS). Dixon launched EMS to help private service professionals who manage similar households to benefit from what she had to learn the hard way. 
                        
                        Ashley has always been enamored with luxury lifestyles and enjoyed the status of working for the rich and (sometimes) famous. She also has a fascination with Excel spreadsheets and a compulsion to tackle large, complex projects – by combining these exceptional qualities; EMS was born. </p>

                    <h4>Realize Your Accomplishments with EMS</h4>
                        <p>Her path toward EMS began when she discovered an online project-management platform, which she customized thoroughly until she was ready for virtually any domestic contingency. Eventually, she turned a generic piece of software into the estate manager's bible. This innovative system represents her commitment to helping like-minded individuals and industry professionals foster a gracious lifestyle but don't have the luxury of time to develop an online plan.

                            Developing EMS made Dixon feel she'd accomplished something that could aid her colleagues in realizing their accomplishments.
                            
                            By giving estate managers the tools and training they need to provide their best service – empowering them to live their best lives – EMS represents Ashley's motto: 
                            
                       <em>     "Only the best, by the best, for the best."</em> </p>
